<div>
    <p>
    The duration (in seconds) for which the plugin will remember errors encountered during provisioning.
    </p>
    <p>
    If an error is encountered while provisioning an agent on a Mac host
    then that host will be ignored for this duration,
    allowing Jenkins' subsequent provisioning attempts to use other (hopefully working) hosts
    (potentially on other clouds, if configured).
    </p>
    <p>
    Defaults to 300 (5 minutes) if not set (or set to an invalid value).
    A value of zero disables this functionality (so that recent errors will not be taken into consideration when provisioning).
    </p>
